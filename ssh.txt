Today I have learned SSH, so I really used termius on my mac, and connected to my windows laptop:

ssh myname@my.ip.address
mypassword

and vualiaaaaaaaa


and then I activated kali linux on my virtual box, so I connected to kal linux via mac, and it is really cool! 

I like it!


And I found out that mac does not let login remotely so you have to go to settings and turn it on manually, I think it is good and safe!
